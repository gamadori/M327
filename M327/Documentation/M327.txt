Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU 
                and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then 
                the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage 
                for details about the communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.  [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer can 
                be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication

   - AS1_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error),

                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:
